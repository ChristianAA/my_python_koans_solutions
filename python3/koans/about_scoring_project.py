# Greed is a dice game where you roll up to five dice to accumulate
# points.  The following "score" function will be used calculate the
# score of a single roll of the dice.
#
# A greed roll is scored as follows:
#
# * A set of three ones is 1000 points
#
# * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the
#   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).
#
# * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
#
# * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.
#
# * Everything else is worth 0 points.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# score([1,1,1,5,1]) => 1150 points
# score([2,3,4,6,2]) => 0 points
# score([3,4,5,3,3]) => 350 points
# score([1,5,1,2,4]) => 250 points
#
# More scoring examples are given in the tests below:
#
# Your goal is to write the score method.

def score(dice):

    # Variable for the total score
    score = 0;

    # Create a dict: Received set of rolls will be keys and we will assign'0' value to each key:

    # Example:
    # rolls = {}.fromkeys(set([1,2,3,4,5]), 0);  --> {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0}
    # rolls = {}.fromkeys(set([1,2,2,1,4]), 0); --> {1: 0, 2: 0, 4: 0}
    rolls = {}.fromkeys(set(dice),0);

    # Count how many times appears a value in "dice" and increase the value in the dict for all the existing keys

    # Example:
    # set([1,2,2,1,4]) --> {1: 2, 2: 2, 4: 1}
    for number in dice:
        rolls[number] += 1

    # First scoring condition: A set of three ones is 1000 points.
    # If the "1" key exists and there are 3 or more "ones" in our rolls, add 1000 to the total score.
    # Then subtract 3 from key "1" (we need to add 100 for all the "ones" that are not part of a set of three)

    # Example
    # If there are 5 ones ([1,1,1,1,1]) --> {1: 5}
    # before: value = 5 score = 0,
    # after: value = 2 score = 1000. Then we will add (2 * 100 + 1000) to the total score (see 3ยบ condition)
    if 1 in rolls and rolls[1] >= 3:
       score += 1000
       rolls[1] -= 3

    # Second scoring condition: A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the number.
    # If there are 3 or more "x" values in our rolls, add 100*x to the total score.
    # Then subtract 3 from key "x" (we need to add 50 for all the "fives" that are not part of a set of three,
    # as we did with "ones")
    for number in rolls:
        if rolls[number] >= 3:
            score += number * 100
            rolls[number] -= 3

    # Finally, third and fourth scoring conditions:
    for number in rolls:
        # Third scoring condition: A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
        if number == 1:
            score += 100 * rolls[number]
        # Fourth scoring condition: A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.
        elif number == 5:
            score += 50 * rolls[number]
